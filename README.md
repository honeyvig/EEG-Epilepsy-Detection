# EEG-Epilepsy-Detection
AI expert with expertise in EEG (electroencephalogram) epilepsy detection and classification. Below is a Python code template that demonstrates how such a specialized candidate might approach building and implementing EEG epilepsy detection models. This example uses machine learning to classify epilepsy from EEG signals using a basic pipeline.

Note that this is a simplified version, and in a real-world scenario, it would require a more detailed approach, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, and fine-tuning the model.
Python Code Template for EEG Epilepsy Detection:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simulate loading an EEG dataset (e.g., from a .csv or data file)
# Assuming the dataset has a column 'target' for epilepsy classification (0: non-epileptic, 1: epileptic)
# And EEG signal features in the form of columns 'feature1', 'feature2', ..., 'featureN'
data = pd.read_csv('eeg_data.csv')  # Replace with actual path to dataset

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Data preprocessing - removing missing values and separating features/labels
data = data.dropna()
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)  # Features (EEG signals)
y = data['target']  # Labels (epileptic or not)

# Normalize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Train-test split (80% train, 20% test)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Build and train a classification model (Random Forest here, but you can use others like SVM, NN)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
print('\nClassification Report:')
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# Visualize the feature importances (Optional)
features = X.columns
importances = model.feature_importances_

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.barh(features, importances)
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importance in Epilepsy Detection')
plt.show()

# Save the trained model for later use (Optional)
import joblib
joblib.dump(model, 'epilepsy_detection_model.pkl')

# Load the model (for future predictions)
# model = joblib.load('epilepsy_detection_model.pkl')

Key Aspects of the Code:

    Dataset Loading: The eeg_data.csv file would be the EEG signal dataset where each row corresponds to a set of EEG features and a target label (epileptic or not).
    Data Preprocessing: Missing data is removed, and the features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the EEG signals.
    Modeling: We use RandomForestClassifier here, but you can replace it with other algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, or more advanced deep learning models.
    Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy_score and classification_report, which provide a deeper analysis of the model's performance.
    Feature Importance: A visualization of the feature importance helps in understanding which features contribute most to the epilepsy detection.

Customization:

    Algorithm: You can try different algorithms (e.g., LSTM for sequential data) based on your project's needs.
    Feature Engineering: Depending on the EEG data, you may need to do more advanced feature extraction, such as wavelet transforms or spectral analysis.

This is a basic starting point. The actual implementation would involve working closely with data scientists, domain experts, and engineers to handle the nuances of EEG signal data and ensure optimal model performance.
